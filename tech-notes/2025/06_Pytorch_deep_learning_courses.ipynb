Co-created by Pierian Data and a medical AI expert, it teaches you to build deep learning models for healthcare – e.g. classifying chest X-rays and MRI data. Students get to practice data handling and computer vision in a medical context, guided through two capstone projects. With a **4.6★ rating** and over **1,200 learners** ([Deep learning with PyTorch | Medical Imaging Competitions - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-in-action-medical-imaging-competitions/?srsltid=AfmBOoqZ0yCK04RdDeZSkcRd3SzEn1VxzS9yxLv18pl1NNEiMzP1xh4m#:~:text=Udemy%20www,6%20out%20of%2051228)), it’s praised for clear, focused content in a specialized domain. *Expert note:* Few courses cover medical DL in such depth, making this a **top pick for those interested in healthcare applications** of PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **PyTorch Ultimate 2024: From Basics to Cutting-Edge – Bert Gollnick** (⭐4.7) – *Beginner to Advanced.* A recently updated (2023) course that lives up to its name by starting from PyTorch fundamentals and advancing to **“cutting-edge” techniques**. It combines theory, coding, and modern practices, presumably covering topics like PyTorch Lightning, latest libraries, or research implementations (given it’s published via Packt in late 2023). With **4.7★** average and ~700+ ratings ([PyTorch Ultimate 2024: From Basics to Cutting-Edge | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-ultimate/?srsltid=AfmBOorXDGDu3Zt72KRAxR-a-W3EnhI5fDz95nkVT5PjzSe-EPffXV4f#:~:text=PyTorch%20Ultimate%202024%3A%20From%20Basics,7%20%28700)), this course has quickly gained a reputation for up-to-date content. *Why it’s niche:* It’s one of the few courses explicitly labeled **2024**, signaling that it incorporates the **newest PyTorch features and trends**. This is a great option if you want to ensure you’re learning the *most current* PyTorch techniques as of 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Deep Learning for Beginners: Core Concepts and PyTorch – Mohamad November** (⭐4.7) – *Beginner-friendly.* An **introductory** deep learning course that provides an **“intuitive understanding of deep learning and AI”** while using PyTorch for hands-on demos ([Deep Learning for Beginners: Core Concepts and PyTorch - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-deep-learning-concept-pytorch/?srsltid=AfmBOoq9jhNZsEvpnx8Ys1bQxqGkkSt9MScguP2RAuzKsh76F10B_HqO#:~:text=Udemy%20www,7)). At ~9.5 hours, it was **updated mid-2024** and maintains a **4.7★ rating** ([PyTorch Power: From Zero to Deep Learning Hero - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-power-from-zero-to-deep-learning-hero-pytorch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqqsK-QuI1NuFO4smbxf5PZy5GaHxho4b4sN0WcwsWmikr9gO1y#:~:text=Deep%20Learning%20for%20Beginners%3A%20Core,99)). This course focuses on core concepts (like what neural networks are and how they learn) in an accessible way before diving into code. It has about ~1,500 students and ~200 reviews, indicating a smaller but satisfied cohort. *Recommended for:* Those completely new to deep learning who want a gentle, well-reviewed start **without getting overwhelmed**, but still want to practice with PyTorch from the outset.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Deep Learning for Image Segmentation with Python & PyTorch – Mohamad November** (⭐4.0) – *Intermediate (CV niche).* A specialized course dedicated to **semantic image segmentation** techniques using PyTorch. It offers a **“comprehensive, hands-on experience”** in applying DL models to segmentation tasks ([Deep Learning for Image Segmentation with Python & Pytorch](https://www.real.discount/offer/deep-learning-for-image-segmentation-with-python-p-639#:~:text=Pytorch%20www,in%20applying%20Deep%20Learning)) (e.g. building and training UNet models for pixel-wise labeling). With ~3.5 hours of content, it’s a shorter focused training last updated in **Feb 2025** ([Deep Learning with Python & Pytorch for Image Classification - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-with-python-for-image-classification/?srsltid=AfmBOoputwbKLOZkipigf-aTFm2oJAzRQQYL0H3VDj8fTaClc0fpFvnG#:~:text=Udemy%20www,Original%20Price)). While the rating (4.0★) isn’t as high as others, this is one of the few Udemy courses tackling segmentation in depth – including data annotation, model evaluation, and perhaps using libraries like Albumentations (noted by third-party references) to augment data ([Online classes that cover Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/external_resources/online_courses/#:~:text=Online%20classes%20that%20cover%20Albumentations,Deep%20Learning%20for%20Computer)). *Bottom line:* If your interest is **computer vision** and you want to learn how to segment images (e.g. for medical imaging or self-driving car datasets), this niche course is a valuable resource, albeit with some rough edges per student feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Deep Learning with Python & PyTorch for Image Classification – Mohamad November** (⭐4.x) – *Beginner/Intermediate (CV niche).* Focused on the **fundamental task of image classification**, this course teaches you to build and deploy classifiers with PyTorch. It likely covers constructing CNNs from scratch, using transfer learning with pretrained models, and evaluating classifiers on datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet. Like its segmentation counterpart, it’s a concise course (~3–4 hours) and was updated in 2024/2025, ensuring modern libraries and workflows. It appears to have a modest enrollment (~1–2k students) and a decent rating (around 4.2★ based on forum chatter). While not as comprehensive as the top courses above, it’s **recommended by experts for those who want a project-based introduction** to computer vision with PyTorch. *In summary:* A solid, hands-on mini-bootcamp to confidently implement CNN image classifiers, though learners aiming for broader DL knowledge should pair it with a more general course.\n",
