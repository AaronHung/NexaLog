    "你上傳的這份 LICENSE 是 **BSD 2-Clause License**（簡稱 BSD-2），它是一種非常寬鬆、簡單的開源授權條款。以下是你應該注意的重點，以及你在使用原始碼時可以怎麼做。\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ BSD-2 License 的主要條款（2 個條件）：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **保留原始版權聲明與免責聲明**\n",
    "   - 原始碼中原作者的 **copyright** 聲明與 **license 條款** 必須保留。\n",
    "   - 無論你有沒有修改原始碼，只要你分發該軟體（包括編譯後的二進位檔），都必須附帶原始的授權聲明。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **免責條款**\n",
    "   - 原始作者不為使用此程式碼導致的任何損害負責（例如 bug、損失、法律責任等）。\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 😎 那我可以怎麼用？\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ 你**可以**：\n",
    "- **自由使用、修改、整合**該原始碼到你自己的專案中。\n",
    "- **用於商業產品**，甚至**變成封閉源碼**也可以。\n",
    "- **重新命名、重構**，甚至把原來的邏輯大改都沒問題。\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ 但你**必須**：\n",
    "- 在你發佈的產品（無論是原始碼或二進位檔）中，**附上 BSD-2 授權條款**與原作者的著作權聲明。\n",
    "- 不可以刪除或隱藏原始授權中列出的資訊。\n",
    "- 如果你宣稱自己是作者，必須清楚區分你與原始作者的貢獻，否則可能涉及誤導。\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 實際例子\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 你可以這樣做：\n",
    "- 把某個 BSD-2 授權的 GitHub 專案整合進你的 AI 工具中，重寫一半邏輯，命名為你自己的工具。\n",
    "- 產品變成收費服務也沒問題。\n",
    "- 只要你在 README 或 LICENSE 裡加上這段話（範例）：\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "This project includes code originally developed by [Original Author] under the BSD 2-Clause License.\n",
    "Copyright (c) 2020, Original Author\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 如果你是發佈 Python package / GitHub 專案？\n",
    "\n",
    "在你的專案中：\n",
    "- 加一份 `LICENSE` 檔案，包含原始 BSD-2 條款。\n",
    "- 在 `setup.py` 或 `pyproject.toml` 中標註 license 為 `BSD-2-Clause`。\n",
    "- 如果有改動過來源，也可以加一句說明：\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "This is a modified version of the original code from [Project Link].\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧾 結論簡單一句話：\n",
    "\n",
    "> BSD-2 License 給你極大的自由，只要你保留原始的聲明與授權條款，就可以隨便用、改、商用。\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
