    "# 📌 PhD Research Roadmap: Agentic CRAG & Next-Gen RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1️⃣ Research Vision & Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goal**: Redefine Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by integrating Agentic AI techniques (memory, reflection, multi-agent collaboration, tool use) to develop a more autonomous, adaptive, and insightful knowledge retrieval framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Current RAG systems (e.g., CRAG, GraphRAG, KAG) enhance retrieval but remain static decision pipelines.\n",
    "- ✅ The rise of Agentic AI provides new opportunities to transform RAG into an **active knowledge management agent**.\n",
    "- ✅ **Enterprise AI Knowledge Systems** demand **structured retrieval, multi-layer memory, and self-optimizing retrieval-evaluation loops**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚀 Key Research Hypothesis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instead of treating retrieval as a static process, RAG should dynamically assess, refine, and curate knowledge—adapting over time to domain needs, enterprise structures, and personal expertise.\n",
