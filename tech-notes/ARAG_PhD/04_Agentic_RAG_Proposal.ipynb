    "# Agentic CRAG: Towards Reflective, Tool-Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Multi-Agent Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Motivation and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generation capabilities, yet they often hallucinate due to insufficient or incorrect internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a common solution by supplementing LLMs with external knowledge. However, RAG is fragile‚Äîwhen the retriever fails, the generator propagates errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrective RAG (CRAG) introduces a retrieval evaluator to judge the quality of retrieved documents and conditionally re-trigger external web search or refine knowledge. While this improves robustness, CRAG remains static in decision-making: fixed confidence thresholds, limited correction loops, and no capacity for dynamic self-reflection or reasoning about tool choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Research Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose **Agentic CRAG**, a next-generation framework that evolves CRAG into an agent-driven system. It integrates principles from **Agentic AI**‚Äîreflection, tool use, planning, and collaboration‚Äîinto the RAG correction pipeline. The goal is to empower CRAG with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- üß† Reflective decision-making\n",
    "- üîß Autonomous tool selection and usage\n",
    "- üß≠ Strategic planning in information retrieval\n",
    "- ü§ù Multi-agent collaboration and specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging **Multi-Context Protocol (MCP)** as the control layer, we will register and orchestrate CRAG‚Äôs multi-agent pipelines within a unified execution interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Core Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reflection-Augmented Retrieval Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Move beyond static thresholds: implement a feedback-aware evaluator that uses historical generations to refine retrieval confidence.\n",
    "   - Incorporate self-critique modules inspired by Self-RAG and GPT Reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool-Driven Correction Agents**\n",
    "   - Integrate OpenAI‚Äôs open tools (Web Search, File Search, CUA) into CRAG.\n",
    "   - Agents decide which tools to use, when, and how based on uncertainty, failure signals, and internal heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Agent Knowledge Processing**\n",
    "   - Divide the correction pipeline into roles: Retriever, Evaluator, Refiner, Planner.\n",
    "   - Use LangGraph for execution flow; register agent pipelines with **MCP** to support modularity and inter-agent messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Planning with LangGraph + MCP**\n",
    "   - Implement adaptive control logic that selects correction strategies dynamically.\n",
    "   - Enable rollbacks, retries, and iterative correction loops in RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Agentic CRAG System**\n",
    "   - Deploy a complete agentic RAG framework.\n",
    "   - Support plug-and-play integration with existing LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Architecture**: Extend the original CRAG framework with LangGraph flow management.\n",
    "- **Agents**:\n",
    "  - Retrieval Agent: queries and filters external knowledge\n",
    "  - Evaluation Agent: judges relevance with reflection\n",
    "  - Refinement Agent: segments, ranks, and recomposes knowledge\n",
    "  - Planner Agent: coordinates execution strategy based on outcome signals\n",
    "- **Tool APIs**: Integrated access to OpenAI‚Äôs Tool Use interfaces\n",
    "- **MCP Registry**: Register each pipeline as a service using Multi-Context Protocol for seamless composition and runtime adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Experimental Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets**: PopQA, HotpotQA, WebGPT, DoTQA\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics**:\n",
    "- Accuracy / FactScore\n",
    "- Knowledge Source Utilization\n",
    "- Tool Use Efficiency\n",
    "- Generation Robustness to Retrieval Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ablation Studies**:\n",
    "- With/without reflection\n",
    "- With/without planning\n",
    "- With/without MCP agent routing\n",
    "- Single-agent vs multi-agent pipeline\n",

    "## 7. Broader Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic CRAG brings autonomy and adaptability to information retrieval systems. It shifts from passive RAG to an active knowledge-seeking paradigm. Beyond academic benchmarks, it can be deployed in real-world applications like legal search, medical QA, and autonomous research assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the correctness focus of CRAG with the dynamism of Agentic AI, this work aims to contribute foundational methods to the next generation of trustworthy, tool-empowered language systems.\n",
