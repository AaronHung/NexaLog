    "# 🧪 Experiment Setup: Retrieval Evaluation for RAG Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1️⃣ Experiment Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goal:** To evaluate and improve retrieval evaluation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by integrating advanced models (T5, DeepSeek, GPT-4 Turbo) and novel evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔍 Research Questions:**\n",
    "1. Can we design a **multi-factor evaluation metric** that goes beyond binary relevance?\n",
    "2. How do different **retrieval evaluation models** (T5, DeepSeek, GPT-4 Turbo) compare in accuracy and robustness?\n",
    "3. Can we use **confidence-based multi-RAG fusion** to enhance retrieval precision?\n",
    "4. How does retrieval evaluation impact final RAG-generated answer quality?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **2️⃣ Experiment Design & Methodology**\n",

    "### **🛠️ Baseline Models for Retrieval Evaluation**\n",
    "- **T5-Large Fine-Tuned on QA Pairs** *(Current CRAG setup)*\n",
    "- **DeepSeek-Fine-Tuned on Multi-Domain Retrieval Tasks**\n",
    "- **GPT-4 Turbo (Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting for Retrieval Evaluation)**\n",
    "- **Hybrid LLM + Contrastive Learning (SimCSE or Contriever) for Document Scoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Hypothesis:** Higher-capacity models (GPT-4 Turbo, DeepSeek) can offer better **context-aware retrieval evaluation**, but may be computationally expensive.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **📊 Evaluation Metrics for Retrieval Quality**\n",
    "| Metric | Definition | Why It Matters |\n",
    "|--------|-----------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Relevance** | Does the document contain an answer to the query? | Baseline binary relevance (current RAG approach) |\n",
    "| **Correctness** | Is the information factually accurate? | Prevents misinformation in RAG outputs |\n",
    "| **Insightfulness** | Does the document provide novel/contextually important information? | Rewards higher-quality retrievals |\n",
    "| **Retrieval Robustness** | Does the model handle ambiguous or multi-hop queries well? | Ensures system reliability under complex queries |\n",
    "| **Faithfulness** | How often does the retrieved document align with the generated answer? | Measures whether retrievals actually impact final output |\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Hypothesis:** Traditional **binary relevance metrics are insufficient**; multi-factor evaluation improves retrieval filtering.\n",
